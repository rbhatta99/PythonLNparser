Hill of New Hampshire took some time to talk with Wikinews about his campaign for the U.S. Republican Party\\u0027s 2016 presidential nomination.\",\"Hill served in TEMPLATE[w, Operation Desert Storm], flying about fifty combat missions.  Shortly after the war, he returned to civilian life, working as a loader and then a pilot for the TEMPLATE[w, United Parcel Service].  In 2010, he organized the \\\"Pilots and Patriots Defending the Constitution\\\" ahead of the that year\\u0027s midterm elections.  Hill ran his first campaign for president in 2012, seeking the Republican nomination.  In that cycle, he appeared on the primary ballot in two states, receiving 108 votes in the TEMPLATE[w, New Hampshire primary] and 139 in the Arizona primary.  Former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney ultimately received the nomination and lost to incumbent president Barack Obama.\",\"With Wikinews reporter William S.

I took the Oath to our TEMPLATE[w, United States Constitution, Constitution] at 22 years old. I understood it was an Oath to America and ALL of our people.  Politicians profess an Oath to this nation but once in office pursue their party agenda and reward their voters.  As President, I will serve ALL of the people in America, guided by the Constitution.\",\":TEMPLATE[WNIR, Hill] When I was a young man in Air Force TEMPLATE[w, Reserve Officers\\u0027 Training Corps, ROTC] I was chosen to attend a unique Pilot Training Program called Euro-NATO Joint Jet Pilot Training.  The Air Force only selected 180 Officers a year from the Academy, Squadron Officer School and ROTC to attend.  I volunteered for that program because I knew I wanted to be a Fighter Pilot and at the \\\"Tip of the Spear.\\\"  In those days it was all or nothing.  If you graduated you were assigned a fighter, if you were not quite fighter pilot material you had no recourse to fly another aircraft, you were washed out.  Congress has proven itself ineffective as a body.  To make a difference in America you must have the \\\"TEMPLATE[wikt, bully pulpit, Bully Pulpit]\\\" and speak to the People. The President has that pulpit.  All or nothing.  I never wanted to make politics a career.\",\":TEMPLATE[WNIR, Hill] My ties to the Republican party date back to 1979 when I volunteered for TEMPLATE[w, Ronald Reagan] and his campaign in New Hampshire. In those days I believed there was a difference in the parties.  Today, like many Americans, I am skeptical.  I understand third party candidates have no success.  I hope to lead the Republican party in a new direction for working middle class Americans.\",\":TEMPLATE[WNIR, Hill] In order to be invited to the debates, we must raise money and poll nationally.

His use of the Presidency to further this agenda has in many ways been unconstitutional.  Specifically, altering law once it is passed to accommodate his voting blocs.

2015] TEMPLATE[South_Africa] South African Justice Minister TEMPLATE[w, Michael Masutha] yesterday announced he is granting parole to TEMPLATE[w, Eugene de Kock], an TEMPLATE[w, apartheid]-era assassin who has spent twenty years in prison. TEMPLATE[w, Jann Turner]TEMPLATE[Image_credit, George Hallett] After South Africa\\u0027s first democratic elections in 1994 de Kock was arrested and subsequently detailed his actions to the nation\\u0027s TEMPLATE[w, Truth and Reconciliation Commission] (TRC). As head of a TEMPLATE[w, South African Police, police] \\u0027counter-insurgency\\u0027 unit de Kock took responsibility for murdering and torturing dissidents opposed to white-only rule. His methods included bombings, shootings, and stabbings and he operated internationally and at home. His revelations earned him the nickname \\\"Prime Evil\\\".\",\"The TRC granted de Kock immunity for most crimes in exchange for his testimony. He was charged with remaining offences, not covered due to limits in TRC power, and in 1996 jailed for life for six murders. Additional convictions include kidnap and attempted murder. He received an additional 212-year term for those crimes. The TRC could only grant immunity where the offence was a human rights violation and the offender gave a full confession.\",\"During his TRC testimony de Kock accused police commanders of ordering murders including those of TEMPLATE[w, African National Council] (ANC) members. In a 2007 prison interview he said TEMPLATE[w, FW de Klerk], the last white President, had hands \\\"soaked in blood\\\". De Klerk denies de Kock\\u0027s allegations he ordered individual murders. TEMPLATE[QuoteLeft, It\\u0027s mixed feelings, which is something we\\u0027ve gotten used to as South Africans, 4\\u003dEddie Makue] In the early nineties de Kock teamed up with anti-ANC party TEMPLATE[w, Inkatha] to arrange violence within black communities. Internal conflict killed 12,000 in the wake of future President Nelson Mandela\\u0027s release. Mandela wrote of fearing \\\"a hidden hand behind the violence[...] attempting to disrupt the negotiations\\\", by orchestrating the clashes in TEMPLATE[w, Natal] and TEMPLATE[w, Transvaal]. He was referring to upcoming elections and a transfer of power away from white rule and apartheid.\",\"Masutha said de Kock was being released \\\"in the interest of reconciliation and nation building\\\". The date, location, and terms are to remain secret.\",\"Reaction from his victims is varied.\",\"Murder victim Glenack Mama\\u0027s widow Sandra welcomed the release. She said to a BBC reporter \\\"I think it will actually close a chapter in our history because we\\u0027ve come a long way and I think his release will just once again help with the reconciliation process because there\\u0027s still a lot of things that we need to do as a country\\\". She said \\\"He got the instructions from the top and they [more senior officials] got away with it[...] they\\u0027re amongst us today and one man is taking the fall\\\". TEMPLATE[QuoteRight, I pray that those whom he hurt, those from whom he took loved ones, will find the power within them to forgive him, 4\\u003dDesmond Tutu] Eddie Makue said to The Associated Press the release stirred up \\\"mixed feelings, which is something we\\u0027ve gotten used to as South Africans\\\". He was a TEMPLATE[w, South African Council of Churches] employee in 1988 when de Kock bombed their headquarters. Jane Quin said she was \\\"terribly disappointed\\\" and he should never be released.  Her sister Jacqui Quin was murdered in Lesotho in 1985 by de Kock.\",\"TRC chairman Archbishop TEMPLATE[w, Desmond Tutu] said \\\"I pray that those whom he hurt, those from whom he took loved ones, will find the power within them to forgive him.\\\" He said the release would not be universally welcome but is nonetheless \\\"to our collective credit, as people and as a nation.\\\" Tutu called it \\\"an indictment on our government\\\" that apartheid officials who did not co-operate with the TRC had evaded prosecution.\",\"Whilst in prison de Kock has assisted the recovery of his missing victims\\u0027 remains. Remorse and his help to the TEMPLATE[w, Missing Persons Task Team] were cited by Masutha as reasons to release him, which was initially decided against last July. \\\"[H]is key role has been to introduce us to other former security police who can assist with finding others,\\\" said Task Team leader Madeleine Fullard. Fullard said de Kock had also directly assisted in retrieving two bodies. \\\"He certainly feels lives were wasted for no reason\\\", she added, describing a meeting with him at one ANC victim\\u0027s grave. \\\"He seemed to be quite stressed.\\\"\",\"Masutha also announced yesterday the rejection of a parole application by apartheid killer TEMPLATE[w, Clive Derby-Lewis], an ex-MP. Derby-Lewis is serving life for murdering popular TEMPLATE[w, South African Communist Party] leader TEMPLATE[w, Chris Hani]. Hani also led the ANC\\u0027s militant division. His killing in 1993 sparked rioting. Derby-Lewis sought parole because he has TEMPLATE[w, lung cancer].

TEMPLATE[image_credit, [[Commons:User:Sabung.hamster, Oka Sudiatmika]]] There were no survivors when Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501 crashed on December 28. The six-year-old TEMPLATE[w, Airbus A320-200] was 40 minutes from Juanda International Airport with 155 passengers and seven crew, bound for Singapore\\u0027s Changi International Airport. Most were Indonesians, with three South Koreans, one Malaysian, one Brit and one French person on board.\",\"One of the latest bodies was a uniformed man strapped into a cockpit seat, and presumed to be either Indonesian Pilot Iriyanto or French co-pilot Remi Emmanuel Plesel. Underwater currents have complicated recovery of the other body from the cockpit. Efforts to retrieve the entire aircraft last month were abandoned. Some bodies have been found roughly 1,000 TEMPLATE[w, kilometre, kilometres] (600 TEMPLATE[w, mile, miles]) from the crash site, floating near Sulawesi.\",\"Iriyanto and Plessel had over 8,000 hours experience between them.

Bullets went through the doors and everyone threw themselves to the floor.\\\"\",\"The second attack yesterday took place outside a synagogue in the TEMPLATE[w, Krystalgade] area of Copenhagen. The attacker shot and killed, according to the local Jewish community, Dan Uzan, a 37-year-old Jewish man who was volunteering as a security guard outside the synagogue while a TEMPLATE[w, bat mitzvah] service was held inside. TEMPLATE[image_credit, [[Commons:User:Kim Bach, Kim Bach]]] Following the attacks, police released a description and photo of the suspect: he was depicted wearing a black puffer jacket, carrying a black bag, wearing a maroon balaclava, aged between 25 and 30 with a black automatic weapon. The chief police inspector Torben Molgaard Jensen told reporters: \\\"We assume that it\\u0027s the same culprit behind both incidents.\\\"\",\"TEMPLATE[w, Helle Thorning-Schmidt], the Danish Prime Minister, said yesterday: \\\"We feel certain now that it\\u0027s a politically motivated attack, and thereby it is a terrorist attack.\\\"\",\"Lars Vilks in a statement to Associated Press said he believed the first attack was directed at him: \\\"What other motive could there be?

Court of the United Kingdom, Supreme Court] of the TEMPLATE[w, United Kingdom] have concluded yesterday that the government must release a series of 27 letters sent by TEMPLATE[w, Charles, Prince of Wales, Prince Charles] to government ministers and that attempts to prevent their publication under the TEMPLATE[w, Freedom of Information Act 2000] have been unlawful.\",\"The letters were sent to ministers of the previous TEMPLATE[w, Labour Party (UK), Labour] government in the years of 2004 and 2005 and contain advocacy that has been described as \\\"particularly frank\\\". TEMPLATE[w, The Guardian] newspaper have been attempting to have these letters released using freedom of information legislation for ten years.\",\"In 2012, the Attorney General TEMPLATE[w, Dominic Grieve] blocked the publication of the letters despite a ruling from the TEMPLATE[w, Upper Tribunal, information tribunal] that the release of the letters is in the public interest. Grieve\\u0027s statement at the time argued Prince Charles\\u0027 correspondence was \\\"of very considerable practical benefit\\\" to his \\\"preparations for kingship\\\" as \\\"such correspondence and dialogue will assist him in fulfilling his duties\\\". Grieve went on to argue correspondence of this nature \\\"must be under conditions of confidentiality\\\" otherwise both the Prince and government ministers \\\"will feel seriously inhibited from exchanging views candidly and frankly\\\". The statement from Grieve asserts \\\"The Prince of Wales is party-political neutral\\\" and \\\"it is highly important that he is not considered by the public to favour one political party or another\\\", but that if the letters were released there would be the risk he would be \\\"viewed by others as disagreeing with government policy\\\" and \\\"such perception would be seriously damaging to his role as future Monarch, because if he forfeits his position of political neutrality as heir to the Throne, he cannot easily recover it when he is King.\\\"\",\"TEMPLATE[w, David Neuberger, Baron Neuberger of Abbotsbury, Lord Neuberger], in giving the majority decision of the court, stated the Attorney General could not veto the release \\\"merely because he, a member of the executive, considering the same facts and arguments, takes a different view from that taken by the tribunal or court\\\". Neuberger said the legislation\\u0027s veto power did not go so far as to \\\"enable a member of the executive to over-ride a judicial decision\\\" and that the Attorney General \\\"proceeded on the basis of findings which differed radically from those made by the upper tribunal without real or adequate explanation.\\\"\",\"Appeal judges had subsequently ruled this veto on the part of the Attorney General to be unlawful, and the further appeal by the government to the Supreme Court has been unsuccessful. The government is required to release the documents within 30 days, although it is possible some of the contents may be redacted.\",\"A spokeswoman for the Prince of Wales stated the ruling is \\\"a matter for the Government\\\" but that the Prince is \\\"disappointed the principle of privacy has not been upheld.\\\"\",\"Prime Minister TEMPLATE[w, David Cameron] said the decision was \\\"disappointing\\\": \\\"This is about the principle that senior members of the Royal Family are able to express their views to government confidentially. I think most people would agree this is fair enough.\\\"\",\"A spokeswoman for Cameron elaborated: \\\"The prime minister has been very clear this morning it is a deeply disappointing judgment. He doesn\\u0027t agree with it. He thinks what\u00e2\u0080\u0099s at stake here is an important principle about the ability of senior members of the royal family to express their views to government confidentially. He thinks that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s a principle that we should uphold. So while we have taken steps in this TEMPLATE[w, UK Parliament, parliament] to strengthen the ability to do that through the FOI act, if there needs to be more done to make that clear, then the prime minister is clear those steps should happen in the next parliament.\\\"\",\"The legislation was already amended in 2010 to make it so that correspondence and other matters related to the Royal family are exempt from further freedom of information requests. Graham Smith, from TEMPLATE[w, Republic (political organisation), Republic], which campaigns for an elected head of state, argues there needs to be greater transparency over the Royal Family\\u0027s affairs: \\\"The court has defended democratic principles over the interests of the royal family and that needs to be enshrined in law. David Cameron\u00e2\u0080\u0099s response is worrying because he says he wants to tighten up the veto.\\\"\",\"The Labour MP TEMPLATE[w, Paul Flynn (politician), Paul Flynn] raised the possibility the ruling might have consequences for Charles\\u0027 suitability to be King: \\\"If there are serious questions about the suitability of Prince Charles as a monarch there could be a question in the public mind about whether to skip a generation. The attorney general already said the main justification for keeping the letters secret was they would hinder Charles\\u0027s ability to be a successful monarch.\\\"\",\"TEMPLATE[haveyoursay]\",\"TEMPLATE[Publish] TEMPLATE[Archive]\"],\"categories\":[{\"id\":\"Category:Politics_and_conflicts\",\"description\":\"Category:Politics and conflicts\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Royalty\",\"description\":\"Category:Royalty\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Crime_and_law\",\"description\":\"Category:Crime and law\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Journalism\",\"description\":\"Category:Journalism\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Free_speech\",\"description\":\"Category:Free speech\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Dominic_Grieve\",\"description\":\"Category:Dominic Grieve\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Tom_Morris_(Wikinewsie)\",\"description\":\"Category:Tom Morris (Wikinewsie)\"}],\"templates\":[{\"name\":\"date\",\"description\":[\"March 27, 2015\"]},{\"name\":\"United_Kingdom\",\"description\":[]},{\"name\":\"Image\",\"description\":[\"[http://www.flickr.com/photos/30692593@N07/7597030944 Dan Marsh]\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"Supreme Court of the United Kingdom\",\"Supreme Court\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"United Kingdom\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"Charles, Prince of Wales\",\"Prince Charles\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"Freedom of Information Act 2000\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"Labour Party (UK)\",\"Labour\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"The Guardian\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"Dominic Grieve\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"Upper Tribunal\",\"information tribunal\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"David Neuberger, Baron Neuberger of Abbotsbury\",\"Lord Neuberger\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"David Cameron\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"UK Parliament\",\"parliament\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"Republic (political organisation)\",\"Republic\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"Paul Flynn (politician)\",\"Paul Flynn\"]},{\"name\":\"haveyoursay\",\"description\":[]},{\"name\":\"wikinews\",\"description\":[\"title\\u003dAttorney General vetos release of Prince Charles correspondence\",\"date\\u003dOctober 18, 2012\"]},{\"name\":\"source\",\"description\":[\"url\\u003dhttp://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/mar/26/supreme-court-clears-way-release-secret-prince-charles-letters-black-spider-memos\",\"title\\u003dSupreme court clears way for release of secret Prince Charles letters\",\"author\\u003d Rob Evans, Robert Booth and Rowena Mason\",\"pub\\u003dThe Guardian\",\"date\\u003dMarch 26, 2015\"]},{\"name\":\"source\",\"description\":[\"url\\u003dhttp://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/prince-charles-black-spider-letters-to-be-published-within-weeks-10136889.html\",\"title\\u003dPrince Charles\\u0027 \\u0027black spider\\u0027 letters to be published \\u0027within weeks\\u0027\",\"author\\u003dChris Green\",\"pub\\u003dThe Independent\",\"date\\u003dMarch 26, 2015\"]},{\"name\":\"source\",\"description\":[\"url\\u003dhttps://www.gov.uk/government/publications/evans-v-1-information-commissioner-2-seven-government-departments-2012-ukut-313-aac\",\"title\\u003dEvans v (1) Information Commissioner (2) seven Government Departments \\u0026#91;2012\\u0026#93;

Myers said the AFP knew of the plans of every member of the Bali Nine, excluding Sukumaran, \\\"and they didn\\u0027t want to stop these people.\\\" He said the AFP had the opportunity to arrest the Australians before they left for Indonesia, meaning they would face a prison sentence in Australia, and avoid the death penalty.

The number of new HIV positive cases in Scott County in this outbreak rose past 140.

Pence since offered a 30-day extension as the number of HIV positive cases continued to rise.\",\"Needle exchange programs provide clean needles in exchange for dirty needles.

The TEMPLATE[w, World Health Organization] and the TEMPLATE[w, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention] also recommend needle exchange programs. But experts say long-term needle exchange programs are needed.\",\"The HIV epidemic in Southern Indiana has been linked to a drug problem in Scott County.

process to suggest designs for a new national flag, and determine whether their citizens would prefer a different national flag over the current one.\",\"The current New Zealand flag is partially based on the United Kingdom\\u0027s flag; the new one would be unique to New Zealand. The government\\u0027s Flag Consideration Project has planned a number of conferences and roadshows as part of this process, with the first meeting set to take place in TEMPLATE[W, Christchurch] on May 16. According to the New Zealand Herald, Emeritus Professor John Burrows, the chairman of the project\\u0027s panel of twelve, said New Zealand\\u0027s flag has never before been open to public choice.\",\"Professor Burrows also said resources and kits would be accessible for schools and communities, \\\"For example, schools can run their own flag discussions and referendums to mirror the formal process as part of their own learning exercise\\\". People were encouraged to submit their designs online at www.flag.govt.nz and suggest what the flag should mean on www.standfor.co.nz. Names of participants would be engraved, at their option, on a flag pole monument to be built in the nation\\u0027s capital, TEMPLATE[w, Wellington].\",\"New Zealand\\u0027s Prime Minister John Key said he believes redesigning the flag now has a \\\"strong rationale\\\".  Mr Key promoted the campaign for a unique New Zealand flag on TEMPLATE[w, Waitangi Day] \\u0026mdash; February 6 \\u0026mdash; this year.

On that basis Mr Farage withdrew his resignation and will remain leader of UKIP.

After intending to \\\"take the summer off, enjoy meself a little bit, not do very much politics at all\\\", Farage said, a UKIP leadership election would happen in September; he would decide whether or not to stand again as leader at a later date. On the same day, Ed Miliband had announced he would stand down as Labour leader, while Nick Clegg said he would resign as leader of the Liberal Democrats.\",\"UKIP achieved a 12.6% share of the vote at the general election, an increase of 9.5% on their 2010 performance, placing them third behind Labour and Conservatives in terms of popular vote.

Farage has claimed these results illustrate how TEMPLATE[w, First-past-the-post voting, first-past-the-post], the electoral system used in UK general elections, is \\\"bankrupt because one party can get 50% of the vote in Scotland and nearly 100% of the seats, and our party can get 4 million votes and just one seat.

to stand down as Scottish Labour Party leader next month, after narrowly surviving a TEMPLATE[w, Motion of no confidence, no confidence] vote. Murphy said he will present a list of suggested reforms to be made to the party, including changing the system for electing party leader to TEMPLATE[w, One member, one vote, one member, one vote], upon offering his resignation at the next meeting of its national executive in June. Murphy also said he will not stand for the Scottish Parliament TEMPLATE[w, Scottish Parliament general election, 2016, election in May 2016] and will \\\"do something else\\\".\",\"At a meeting in the Scottish city Glasgow yesterday, the party\\u0027s national executive held a vote of no confidence in Murphy; he won by 17 votes to 14. \\\"Today I received more support in the executive vote than I did from members of the executive when I stood for election five months ago\\\", Murphy said. Murphy became Scottish Labour leader in December 2014, following TEMPLATE[w, Johann Lamont]\\u0027s resignation from the role. Until Scottish Labour holds a fresh leadership election \\u0026mdash; its sixth in a span of eight years \\u0026mdash; TEMPLATE[w, Kezia Dugdale], currently the party\\u0027s deputy leader, is to assume the role of acting leader for the time being. Murphy cited concerns about Scottish Labour being divided as a contributory factor to his decision. \\\"Scotland needs a strong Labour party; Scotland needs a united Labour party\\\", he said yesterday. \\\"We have been the greatest force for change in our nation\u00e2\u0080\u0099s remarkable history. The Scottish Labour party will rise again. It will be under someone else\u00e2\u0080\u0099s leadership and I am confident about my party\u00e2\u0080\u0099s future.\\\"\",\"The announcement came nine days after the party lost all but one of its 41 Scottish seats, including Murphy\\u0027s TEMPLATE[w, East Renfrewshire (UK Parliament constituency), East Renfrewshire constituency], to the Scottish National Party (SNP) in a UK general election, and eight days after Ed Miliband said he would stand down as leader of the UK Labour Party.\",\"There was controversy regarding whether Murphy should retain his role following this performance. Labour Party supporters were reportedly asked to sign a letter supporting Murphy\\u0027s leadership, to be presented at the executive meeting yesterday. Calls for Murphy to resign came from multiple quarters, including trade unions TEMPLATE[w, Unite the Union, Unite] and TEMPLATE[w, Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, ASLEF], as well as Labour MSPs TEMPLATE[w, Alex Rowley] and TEMPLATE[w, Elaine Smith (Scottish politician), Elaine Smith]. Earlier in the week, Unite general secretary TEMPLATE[w, Len McCluskey] said \\\"the anti-Scottish card that was played by TEMPLATE[w, Lynton Crosby] and the Conservatives\\\" had caused them to win a majority in the general election, before going on to say: \\\"I lay the blame for that very squarely at the feet of Scottish Labour. Not only have they lost Scotland but I think they\\u0027ve been responsible for making certain that the Conservatives were back in power in TEMPLATE[w, Government of the United Kingdom, Westminster].\\\" However, trade unions TEMPLATE[w, Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers, USDAW] and TEMPLATE[w, Community (trade union), Community] were amongst those supporting Murphy\\u0027s continued leadership. TEMPLATE[HYS_question_left, Did Jim Murphy make the right decision?]\",\"In a speech, Murphy suggested he did he did not want the party to be divided as a result of his leadership. \\\"It is clear that the small minority who didn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accept my election as party leader by the majority five months ago also won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t accept the vote of the Executive today and will continue to divide the party if I remain\\\", he said. Murphy singled out McCluskey for criticism, claiming to have \\\"been at the centre of a campaign by the London leadership of the Unite union in blaming myself and the Scottish Labour party for the defeat of the UK Labour party in the general election. That is a grotesque insult to the Scottish Labour party.\\\" He went on to criticise what he called McCluskey\\u0027s \\\"destructive behaviour\\\", commenting that: \\\"Whether in Scotland, or in the contest to come across the UK, we cannot have our leaders selected or deselected by the grudges and grievances of one prominent man. The leader of the Scottish Labour Party doesn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t serve at the grace of Len McCluskey and the next leader of the UK Labour Party should not be picked by Len McCluskey.\\\"\",\"Reacting to the news, SNP leader and Scottish TEMPLATE[w, First Minister of Scotland, First Minister] Nicola Sturgeon tweeted: \\\"I wish Jim Murphy all the very best for the future. Leadership is not easy and he deserves credit for standing up for what he believes in.\\\" Scottish Liberal Democrats leader TEMPLATE[w, Willie Rennie] said: \\\"Credit to [Murphy]. He stepped up and energetically campaigned for his beliefs. I wish him the best for the future.\\\" TEMPLATE[w, Harriet Harman], the acting leader of the UK Labour Party, said Murphy had been a \\\"hugely important figure\\\" for them, adding: \\\"Jim has given so much to the Labour Party over the last twenty years. He, I know reluctantly, took the responsibility for leading Scottish Labour at the most difficult election they have ever faced. He did so with incredible energy, purpose and dignity [...] He leaves with the best wishes and thanks of our movement.\\\"\",\"Scottish Green Party TEMPLATE[wikt, convenor, co-convenor] TEMPLATE[w, Patrick Harvie] was more critical in his response, arguing the Greens should be the opposition of the Scottish Parliament instead. Harvie said Murphy\\u0027s resignation was \\\"almost inevitable, but even as he announced it he promised to further weaken Labour\u00e2\u0080\u0099s relationship with the wider labour movement. People haven\u00e2\u0080\u0099t left Labour because of the trade unions, but because the party itself long ago strayed from its principles. Without a clear sense of purpose, it has seemed to care only about holding office instead of creating new ideas for a better society. It\u00e2\u0080\u0099s clear that the Scottish Parliament needs an opposition that\u00e2\u0080\u0099s creative and challenging, but which can act constructively too.\\\"\",\"Scottish Conservative Party leader TEMPLATE[w, Ruth Davidson] tweeted: \\\"Jim Murphy announces a managed exit in order to help the party, which is to his credit. But leaves a tough gig for whoever comes next.\\\"\",\"Wikinews asked Unite the Union to comment on the story and has yet to receive a response. However, Pat Rafferty, Unite\\u0027s Scotland leader, earlier stated: \\\"Jim has done the decent thing. Scottish Labour needs to recover, re-engage and reform.

The investigation began as a result of photos of the debris being uploaded to the social networking TEMPLATE[w, website] TEMPLATE[w, Facebook]. Some of the debris is reported to have washed ashore as early as May 31 and was found on a beach owned by the Banyan Tree Vabbinfaru resort, located in TEMPLATE[w, Kaafu Atoll]. In the past few days, several other pieces of debris were recovered on at least three other islands. Authorities are trying to determine if it may be part of TEMPLATE[w, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370] (MH370). Last week, a piece of a wing known as a TEMPLATE[w, flaperon], reported to be from MH370, was found washed ashore on TEMPLATE[w, R\u00c3\u00a9union] Island.\",\"Pictures taken of the objects recovered in the Maldives on, reportedly, May 31, were posted to Facebook by an employee of the resort. That prompted authorities to launch an investigation into the debris, but before it could be examined, it had already been sent away for disposal. The photographs show a large white object, possibly two, stained with TEMPLATE[w, algae] and appear to be made of a TEMPLATE[w, fiberglass] and honeycomb material. The objects appear to be several TEMPLATE[w, foot (unit), feet] in length and width and in one photo where the paint is severely peeled, red letters \\\"IC\\\" can be seen.  Those pieces, along with others, were taken away and disposed of as trash. When authorities discovered the photographs, they returned to the site, but only found a small, five to seven TEMPLATE[w, inch] (about 13\\u0026ndash;18\\u0026nbsp;TEMPLATE[w, centimetre, cm]) piece of debris they say doesn\\u0027t appear to be part of a plane.\",\"According to the resort\\u0027s manager Mr. Naseem, the bigger pieces of debris and other waste were taken away and disposed of in the usual way. He added other forms of debris and trash with no value, such as buoys and suspected military waste, wash up on the islands all the time, especially during TEMPLATE[w, monsoon] season. Local residents and resort workers regularly collect trash which is sent to the garbage island TEMPLATE[w, Thilafushi] where it\\u0027s sorted, exported for recycling, or burned. Reports say at the time the debris was collected, no one suspected it could be from MH370.\",\"\\\"Although some of it was taken to Thilafushi, there is still a five or a seven inch piece on the resort. It was left because it is small. The management has decided to hand it over to the Police\\\", said an unnamed official to SunOnline, who said authorities don\\u0027t know if any of the debris taken away has been destroyed. The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of the TEMPLATE[w, Maldives Police Service] and experts from the TEMPLATE[w, Maldives Civil Aviation Authority] are heading the investigation.\",\"Yesterday, reports stated several more pieces of debris, one piece measuring some eight feet by two feet (about 2.4 by 0.6\\u0026nbsp;TEMPLATE[w, metre, m]), were found on TEMPLATE[w, Baa Atoll], TEMPLATE[w, Fehendhoo] and TEMPLATE[w, Fulhadhoo, Fulhahdhoo] and washed ashore sometime in the past few days. One piece appears to have a serial number on the side, possibly reading \\u0027021411270507.\\u0027 Initially residents who found the debris took it home. \\\"A resident had found the debris and taken it home. Nobody had thought twice about it then. When he heard about the discovery in Vabbinfaru resort we immediately called the Police,\\\" said Mohamed Ibrahim, a councilman for Fehendhoo Island, to Haveeru Daily.\",\"MH370, while flying from TEMPLATE[w, Kuala Lumpur], TEMPLATE[w, Malaysia] to TEMPLATE[w, Beijing], TEMPLATE[w, China], vanished without a trace on March 8, 2014. All 239 passengers and crew are believed to be dead. On the day the plane went missing, residents on the small Maldive island of TEMPLATE[w, Kudahuvadhoo] claimed to have seen a very \\\"low flying jumbo jet\\\" crash into the TEMPLATE[w, Indian Ocean]. Some also noted the colors appeared to resemble that of a TEMPLATE[w, Malaysia Airlines] plane. \\\"I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ve never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. We\\u0027ve seen seaplanes, but I\\u0027m sure that this was not one of those.

After upwards of an hour, with the house surrounded by special police units, the suspect was talked out of the house.\",\"David Conley, 49, was arrested by the HSCO and subsequently charged with the crimes.  Reportedly Conley had a lengthy history of violent behavior that landed him in prison multiple times. His most recent stint behind bars came last month, when he was arrested for allegedly slamming his girlfriend\\u0027s head into a refrigerator in the same home involved on Saturday. At the time of the murders, Conley was wanted on an assault charge against a family member.\",\"All eight victims died at the scene.\",\"On Sunday, authorities released the names and ages of the victims:  Valerie Jackson, 40, and Dwayne Jackson, her husband, 50; Nathaniel Jackson, 13; Honesty Jackson, 11; Dwayne Jackson, Jr., 10; Caleb Jackson, 9; Trinity Jackson, 7; and Jonah Jackson, 6.

Conley said he had been living in the house and although he had promised to move out, he did not have elsewhere to go.  He was angered when he returned to find the door locks changed.  Conley also felt all the victims disrespected and mistreated him.  Conley was asked about his son, Nate, by TEMPLATE[w, KPRC-TV, KPRC]\\u0027s Robert Arnold.\",\"\\\"I love Nate.

The pieces were found last Friday. Investigators are trying to determine if they\\u0027re connected to TEMPLATE[w, Malaysia Airlines Flight 370] (MH370).\",\"\\\"The first thing we have to do is to determine if it is actually of plane material\\\", said Liow Tiong Lai, Malaysia\\u0027s transport minister, during a press conference on Sunday. \\\"The objects have been brought back and the investigation team will determine soon if they are debris of the MH370 plane [...] Our team here will confirm if they belong to a plane and if a confirmation is made, the pieces will be sent to the international investigation team to determine if they are from MH370,\\\" he added.\",\"The surface of one of the pieces is flat while the other is constructed of \\\"honeycomb material.\\\" During the press conference, Liow described one the pieces as being \\\"very small, about the size of your hand\\\". TEMPLATE[image, Mohamed Wafir (via Facebook)] The debris was reportedly found while authorities were searching Maldives islands for other possible debris. Pieces of debris that resemble a honeycomb material were found on a beach owned by the Banyan Tree Vabbinfaru resort, located in the Maldives island chain TEMPLATE[w, Kaafu Atoll]. Those pieces are reported to have washed ashore onto the resort island around May 31. The investigation into the Maldives debris began as a result of photos of it being uploaded to the social networking website TEMPLATE[w, Facebook]. The photos show at least two pieces of debris, both appear to be flat, but at least one is made of a honeycomb material. Initially the debris was disposed of as trash and was reportedly sent to the garbage island TEMPLATE[w, Thilafushi], where trash is sorted, exported for recycling, or burned. Reports say at the time the debris was collected, no one suspected it could be from MH370.\",\"Investigators examined several other pieces of debris that washed ashore onto other Maldives locations, the TEMPLATE[w, Baa Atoll] and the islands of TEMPLATE[w, Fehendhoo] and TEMPLATE[w, Fulhadhoo, Fulhahdhoo], and found none of it was related to an aircraft. \\\"My team has witnessed the debris and most of them are negative. They are not related to MH370 and not even plane material,\\\" said Liow on Friday. Around August 10, Abdulla Rasheed, a captain of a cargo boat which recently capsized in the waters off the Maldives, stated of debris then recently discovered, \\\"From the pictures of the debris found on most of the islands, I can almost certainly say that they are from the cargo we were carrying.\\\" In late July, a piece of a wing known as a TEMPLATE[w, flaperon] was found washed ashore on TEMPLATE[w, R\u00c3\u00a9union] Island. The Malaysian government stated it\\u0027s from MH370, but according to TEMPLATE[w, China, Chinese] officials, the piece has yet to be confirmed to be from the aircraft.\",\"MH370, while flying from TEMPLATE[w, Kuala Lumpur], Malaysia to TEMPLATE[w, Beijing], TEMPLATE[w, China], vanished without a trace on March 8, 2014. All 239 passengers and crew are believed to be dead. On the day the plane went missing, residents on the small Maldive island of TEMPLATE[w, Kudahuvadhoo] claimed to have seen a very \\\"low flying jumbo jet\\\" crash into the TEMPLATE[w, Indian Ocean]. Some also noted the colors appeared to resemble that of a TEMPLATE[w, Malaysia Airlines] plane. \\\"I\\u0027ve never seen a jet flying so low over our island before. We\\u0027ve seen seaplanes, but I\\u0027m sure that this was not one of those. I could even make out the doors on the plane clearly\\\", one resident was quoted as saying to the newspaper Haveeru Daily. Some claim the plane appeared to he headed in the direction of TEMPLATE[w, Diego Garcia], but Malaysian authorities have discounted those claims.\",\"\\\"Based on the monitoring up to date, no indication of Flight MH370 has been observed on any military radars in the country [Maldives]. Furthermore, the data of radars at Maldives airports have also been analysed and shows no indication of the said flight,\\\" said Malaysia\\u0027s transport ministry at the time of the

Bush] administration. After his departure, he briefly served as CEO of the TEMPLATE[w, American Red Cross], worked in the cabinet of Indiana TEMPLATE[w, Governor of Indiana, governor] TEMPLATE[w, Mitch Daniels], and worked for the tax consulting firm TEMPLATE[w, alliantgroup]. He announced his candidacy this past March with a sixteen-page open letter in which he outlined the six pillars of his campaign: amnesty for TEMPLATE[w, Illegal immigration in the United States, illegal immigrants], reinstatement of the TEMPLATE[w, military draft], a promise to serve only a single presidential term, and calls for tax reform, deficit reduction, and corporate responsibility.\",\"He was excluded from the August 6 TEMPLATE[w, Fox News] TEMPLATE[w, Republican Party presidential debates, 2016, Republican presidential debate] and has been excluded from most TEMPLATE[w, Nationwide opinion polling for the Republican Party 2016 presidential primaries, presidential polls].  However, he is listed on the Republican Party\\u0027s website as one of 18 candidates and filed a TEMPLATE[w, Federal Election Commission] (FEC) complaint against Fox News for his exclusion from the August 6 debate.\",\"With Wikinews reporter William S. Saturn\u00e2\u0080\u008e, Everson discusses his 2016 campaign, the media blackout of his campaign, and his views on the presidency and the possible Everson administration.\",\":TEMPLATE[WNIR, Mark Everson] The electorate is very unsettled. Americans are fed up with politics as usual, so there is a clear path for a nontraditional candidate. I have extensive private sector experience and know the government inside out, but do not carry the political baggage of ties to special interest groups. I have lived in nine states. As a result, I have seen and know America well, but do not have the deep ties to a particular state or community that would traditionally be associated with seeking a different office.\",\":TEMPLATE[WNIR, Everson] While I have not held elective office, my public service credentials meet or exceed those of many of the candidates in the race. My federal executive branch experience (at TEMPLATE[w, United States Information Agency, USIA], TEMPLATE[w, United States Department of Justice, DOJ], TEMPLATE[w, Office of Management and Budget, OMB], and the TEMPLATE[w, United States Department of Treasury, Treasury]) is greater than that of any candidate in the GOP contest. I managed the nation\\u0027s immigration system under President TEMPLATE[w, Ronald Reagan, Reagan], and in the TEMPLATE[w, Presidency of George W. Bush, administration of President George W. Bush] was instrumental in the creation of the TEMPLATE[w, United States Department of Homeland Security, Department of Homeland Security] and directed the nation\\u0027s tax system as Commissioner of Internal Revenue. Immigration, homeland security and taxes are issues of critical importance to the country and central to the 2016 election.\",\":TEMPLATE[WNIR, Everson] I have campaigned in 26 counties across Iowa and also made campaign stops in New Hampshire.  I have been interviewed on radio shows across the country.\",\":TEMPLATE[WNIR, Everson] I think it is a strong field and that the vigorous policy debate underway in the party is good for the country.\",\":TEMPLATE[WNIR, Everson] I am running as a Republican and am not contemplating a third party or independent candidacy.\",\":TEMPLATE[WNIR, Everson] We have received notice that the FEC has filed the complaint with Fox News, but nothing else.

If so, what have they said?\",\":::TEMPLATE[WNIR, Everson] We have not yet heard from the polling companies.\",\":TEMPLATE[WNIR, Everson] At this still early stage of the race, I am surprised that participation has been limited to established politicians and individuals already enjoying significant name recognition. The process should be about surfacing issues of importance to the country and who can best tackle the challenges at hand.\",\":TEMPLATE[WNIR, Everson] The president has failed to unite the nation, the government is not operating well in any number of areas, and the world is certainly a more dangerous place than when he took office. My main objection to his term in office extends beyond his policy choices to his unprecedented expansion of executive power. I have a track record of implementing the law as written, not as I might wish it to be. The powers of the presidency are significant, but limited under our constitution.\",\":TEMPLATE[WNIR, Everson] The specifics include a rewrite of the tax code to take 150 million Americans off the income tax rolls; holding Wall Street and the big banks accountable to following the law, and taking regulatory actions to increase lending; institution of a program of national service; real, balanced reforms to our entitlement programs to assure their continued viability; rewriting our immigration laws to control our borders and reinforce our tradition of assimilation; and taking reelection politics out of Oval Office decision-making by serving only a single term. More broadly, I would consider an Everson presidency successful if we restore faith in our government at home and abroad, and Americans once again put national interests ahead of self-interest.\",\":TEMPLATE[WNIR, Everson] I know many qualified individuals who would do an excellent job serving the nation, but believe it serves no purpose to disclose particular names at this early date.\",\"TEMPLATE[haveyoursay]\",\"TEMPLATE[interview]\",\"TEMPLATE[Publish] TEMPLATE[Archive]\"],\"categories\":[{\"id\":\"Category:Republican_Party_(United_States)\",\"description\":\"Category:Republican Party (United States)\"},{\"id\":\"Category:United_States\",\"description\":\"Category:United States\"},{\"id\":\"Category:North_America\",\"description\":\"Category:North America\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Politics_and_conflicts\",\"description\":\"Category:Politics and conflicts\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Federal_Election_Commission_of_the_United_States\",\"description\":\"Category:Federal Election Commission of the United States\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Elections\",\"description\":\"Category:Elections\"},{\"id\":\"Category:2016_United_States_presidential_election\",\"description\":\"Category:2016 United States presidential election\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Barack_Obama\",\"description\":\"Category:Barack Obama\"},{\"id\":\"Category:George_W._Bush\",\"description\":\"Category:George W.

The event was placed under the TEMPLATE[w, Racing flags#Yellow flag, caution flag] as safety workers extracted Wilson from his car. Wilson was airlifted to TEMPLATE[w, Lehigh Valley Hospital] in TEMPLATE[w, Allentown, Pennsylvania]. At 9 P.M. TEMPLATE[w, Eastern Standard Time Zone, EST], TEMPLATE[w, INDYCAR] released a statement, announcing that Wilson had suffered a severe head injury, was in critical condition and had fallen into a TEMPLATE[w, coma]. The following day, TEMPLATE[w, Indianapolis Motor Speedway] president Doug Boles and TEMPLATE[w, Hulman \\u0026 Company] Mark Miles officially announced Wilson\\u0027s death.\",\"Karam was able to walk away from the accident, and was evaluated for a right foot injury; he was released from the hospital the same day. Wilson\\u0027s TEMPLATE[w, Andretti Autosport] teammate TEMPLATE[w, Ryan Hunter-Reay] won the race, though he did not celebrate upon finding out about Wilson\\u0027s accident. In Victory Lane, he stated, \\\"My first thoughts are with Justin, for sure[...] He\\u0027s a friend, a teammate, and it\\u0027s a bit hard not knowing anything.\\\"\",\"Wilson, a former Formula One and TEMPLATE[w, Champ Car] driver, did not have a ride entering the TEMPLATE[w, 2015 IndyCar Series season, 2015 season], and joined Andretti on a seven-race deal. The contract had previously been for two races, but after acquiring sponsorship, the deal was increased by five events; earlier in August, Wilson recorded a best finish of second at TEMPLATE[w, Mid-Ohio Sports Car Course].\",\"The accident led to discussions regarding the safety of the cars. A suggestion had been the addition of a TEMPLATE[w, Vehicle canopy, canopy] over the car\\u0027s cockpit. The topic had been controversial: while some supported it for safety reasons, others opposed it because of history, possibly affecting the aerodynamics of the car, limiting one\\u0027s TEMPLATE[w, peripheral vision] and movement inside the car, and worry about escaping an upside-down or burning car. Another had been to tether the nose cone to the car; Hunter-Reay mentioned renderings developed of a boomerang-like debris-deflector positioned in front of the driver. A further question raised had been regarding Wilson\\u0027s height: at 6 TEMPLATE[w, foot (unit), feet], 3.5 TEMPLATE[w, inch, inches] (1.92 TEMPLATE[w, metre, m]) tall, Wilson was the tallest IndyCar Series driver; however, driver TEMPLATE[w, Josef Newgarden] refuted the statement, saying, \\\"They make a regulation for how tall you can be inside the car sitting compared to the TEMPLATE[w, roll cage, roll hoop] [...] It\\u0027s safe for any height for any driver that gets in the car.\\\"\",\"TEMPLATE[haveyoursay]\",\"TEMPLATE[Publish]

TEMPLATE[crime_and_law] In a judgement released today Mr Justice Green, sitting in the TEMPLATE[w, High Court of Justice, High Court] in London, spoke of his \\\"very considerable unease\\\" as he rejected an application by two defendants in a Thai death penalty case. The pair sought a Metropolitan Police report they hoped could assist their defence. TEMPLATE[Image_credit, (TEMPLATE)]TEMPLATE[w, Wikivoyage] The court has expedited the case. Burmese nationals Zaw Lin and Wai Phyo, both 22, are currently on trial accused of murdering David Miller, 24, from Jersey, and Hannah Witheridge, 23, from England. With the defence case due to begin shortly and continue until mid- or late September the court has issued its judgement today following a hearing on Friday.\",\"The case dates to September last year when the victims were found murdered on a TEMPLATE[w, Koh Tao] beach. Witheridge had been raped. The case attracted worldwide attention with Lin and Phyo confessing, before re-enacting the killing in front of the press.\",\"The accused claim the confessions were tortured out of them and the ongoing trial is unfair. UK Prime Minister David Cameron intervened, speaking to Thai Prime Minister TEMPLATE[w, Prayut Chan-o-cha]. Cameron and Chan-o-cha arranged for an observer team from the Metropolitan Police to conduct an inspection of the Thai probe, based on powers in the TEMPLATE[w, Police Act 1996].\",\"A team was duly dispatched and prepared a report with the intent to use it for assisting the victims\\u0027 families. UK police were expressly forbidden, at a ministerial level, to provide any assistance to Thai authorities as the case involves the death penalty. Due to established UK policy on foreign death penalty cases, the report was also not shared with Thailand. It is this report that Lin and Phyo were seeking. TEMPLATE[w, Royal Courts of Justice]TEMPLATE[Image_credit, sjiong via (TEMPLATE)]TEMPLATE[w, Flickr] Using the TEMPLATE[w, Data Protection Act 1998] the defendants asked police for this report to assist their defence, and were denied. That decision was the one challenged unsuccessfully in the High Court. The case pits the two accused trying to defend a death penalty case against the possibility of jeopardising international relations; Thai police co-operated, but only in light of an agreement the report would be confidential.\",\"Legal charity TEMPLATE[w, Reprieve (organisation), Reprieve], who assisted the two men, said in a statement \\\"Concerns about the conduct of the Thai investigation and the safety of any convictions resulting have been raised from the very beginning[...]  only the defence lawyers in Thailand are in a position to judge whether the information could be of assistance.\\\" Mr Justice Green\\u0027s judgement acknowledges he did not know \\\"how the accused might structure their defences\\\" or details about what evidence had been or would be involved. TEMPLATE[image_credit, D. Myles Cullen/(TEMPLATE)]TEMPLATE[w, United States armed forces, U.S. Military] Both men say they were starved, suffocated, stripped naked, exposed to cold temperatures, beaten, threatened, and denied legal representation. The TEMPLATE[w, Royal Thai Police] deny any misconduct. Mr Justice Green read the report himself and decided not to release it as it was of no assistance to the pair.\",\"The report is known to contain some material disputed by Lin and Phyo. It says they repeated their confessions at various times, including in court with legal representation, before retracting them. It also says they have not backed up their torture claims with evidence, medical or otherwise. TEMPLATE[QuoteLeft, This is not a Report which contains, for instance, state secrets, 4\\u003dMr Justice Green] Mr Justice Green said the report described \\\"in many respects [...] no more than the routine conduct of a serious crime investigation. This is not a Report which contains, for instance, state secrets.\\\" He also spoke of his distance from the ongoing trial, prompting him to remark of his \\\"very considerable unease\\\" and having to do \\\"the best I could\\\" \\u0026mdash; not \\\"a comfortable process\\\".\",\"Noting \\\"the issues of both law and fact are complex, novel and difficult\\\" Mr Justice Green\\u0027s judgement notes that, before even hearing the case he promised permission to appeal would be granted, if requested, whatever the outcome. He also promised a swift Court of Appeal hearing to comply with Thai trial time constraints. \\\"The stakes are very high for both sides\\\", he added.\",\"\\\"In my judgment the TEMPLATE[w, common law],\\\" the judgement reads, \\\"and in particular the principles of natural justice and fairness, would in a case such as this which involves the right to life, and the right to a fair trial, as well as powerful countervailing issues of public interest, compel the court to apply the most intense level of anxious scrutiny to the facts to ensure that the accused were not prejudiced.\\\"\",\"Mr Justice Green also ruled the pair, in principal, \\\"have a perfectly proper right to seek access to the personal data for the purpose of using it subsequently in their defence in criminal proceedings\\\", calling the case one about \\\"fundamental rights\\\".\",\"Rosa Curling, who represented both men in the London court, has said they would not appeal. She said Lin and Phyo are \\\"disappointed\\\" but \\\"are reassured that at least a British judge has now looked at the information held by the Metropolitan Police, applying anxious scrutiny, and determined that it would not assist them in their ongoing proceedings in Thailand.\\\"\",\"Wikinews has contacted the Metropolitan Police, usually responsible for policing London, for a statement and is awaiting a response.\",\"TEMPLATE[haveyoursay]\",\"TEMPLATE[Original]\",\"TEMPLATE[Publish] TEMPLATE[Archive]\"],\"categories\":[{\"id\":\"Category:Asia\",\"description\":\"Category:Asia\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Europe\",\"description\":\"Category:Europe\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Thailand\",\"description\":\"Category:Thailand\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Myanmar\",\"description\":\"Category:Myanmar\"},{\"id\":\"Category:United_Kingdom\",\"description\":\"Category:United Kingdom\"},{\"id\":\"Category:England\",\"description\":\"Category:England\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Jersey\",\"description\":\"Category:Jersey\"},{\"id\":\"Category:London\",\"description\":\"Category:London\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Crime_and_law\",\"description\":\"Category:Crime and law\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Sex_crimes\",\"description\":\"Category:Sex crimes\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Human_rights\",\"description\":\"Category:Human rights\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Right_to_a_fair_trial\",\"description\":\"Category:Right to a fair trial\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Death_penalty\",\"description\":\"Category:Death penalty\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Iain_Macdonald_(Wikinewsie)\",\"description\":\"Category:Iain Macdonald (Wikinewsie)\"},{\"id\":\"Category:David_Cameron\",\"description\":\"Category:David Cameron\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Prayut_Chan-o-cha\",\"description\":\"Category:Prayut Chan-o-cha\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Metropolitan_Police\",\"description\":\"Category:Metropolitan Police\"}],\"templates\":[{\"name\":\"date\",\"description\":[\"August 25, 2015\"]},{\"name\":\"crime_and_law\",\"description\":[]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"High Court of Justice\",\"High Court\"]},{\"name\":\"Image_credit\",\"description\":[\"(TEMPLATE)\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"Wikivoyage\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"Koh Tao\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"Prayut Chan-o-cha\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"Police Act 1996\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"Royal Courts of Justice\"]},{\"name\":\"Image_credit\",\"description\":[\"sjiong via (TEMPLATE)\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"Flickr\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"Data Protection Act 1998\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"Reprieve (organisation)\",\"Reprieve\"]},{\"name\":\"image_credit\",\"description\":[\"D.

TEMPLATE[w, cicada]TEMPLATE[image_credit, [http://www.mushroomobserver.org/observer/show_user/181 Danny Newman]] TEMPLATE[WNIQ, Wikinews] What first attracted you to researching ants?\",\":Nick Bos Me and a studymate were keeping a lot of animals during our studies, from beetles, to butterflies and TEMPLATE[w, mantids], to ants. We had the ants in  an observation nest, and I could just look at them for hours, watching  them go about. This was in my third year of Biology study I think. After a while I needed to start thinking about an internship for my M.Sc. studies, and decided to write a couple of professors. I ended up going  to the Centre for Social Evolution at the University of Copenhagen where I did a project on learning in Ants under supervision of Prof. Patrizia d\\u0027Ettorre. I liked it so much there I ended up doing a PhD and I\\u0027ve been working on social insects ever since.\",\"TEMPLATE[WNIQ, Wikinews] What methods and equipment were used for this investigation?\",\":NB This is a fun one. I try to work on a very low budget, and like to  build most of the experimental setups myself (we actually have equipment in the lab nicknamed the \\u0027Nickinator\\u0027, \\u0027i-Nick\\u0027 and the \\u0027Nicktendo64\\u0027). There\\u0027s not that much money in fundamental science at the moment, so I try to cut the costs wherever possible. We collected  wild colonies of Formica fusca by searching through old tree-trunks in old logging sites in southern Finland. We then housed the ants in nests I made using Y-tong [TEMPLATE[w, aerated concrete]]. It\\u0027s  very soft stone that you can easily carve. We carved out little  squares for the ants to live in (covered with old CD covers to prevent  them escaping!). We then drilled a tunnel to a pot (the foraging  arena), where the ants got the choice between the food with medicine  and the food without.\",\":We infected the ants by preparing a solution of the fungus Beauveria bassiana. Afterwards, each ant was dipped in the solution for a couple  of seconds, dried on a cloth and put in the nest. After exposing the  ants to the fungus, we took pictures of each foraging arena three times per day, and counted how many ants were present on each food-source.\",\":This gave us the data that ants choose more medicine after they have  been infected.\",\":The result that healthy ants die sooner when ingesting ROS [TEMPLATE[w, Reactive oxygen species, Reactive Oxygen Species], the group of chemicals that includes hydrogen peroxide] but infected ants die less was obtained in another way (as you have to \\u0027force feed\\u0027 the ROS, as healthy ants, when given the choice, ignore  that food-source.)\",\":For this we basically put colonies on a diet of either food with medicine or without for a while. And afterwards either infected them  or not. Then for about two weeks we count every day how many ants  died. This gives us the data to do a so-called survival analysis.\",\":We measured the ROS-concentration in the bodies of ants after they ingested the food with the medicine using a TEMPLATE[w, spectrophotometry, spectrophotometer]. By  adding certain chemicals, the ROS can be measured using the emission of light of a certain wave-length.\",\":The detrimental effect of ROS on spores was easy to measure. We mixed  different concentrations of ROS with the spores, plated them out on TEMPLATE[w, petri dishes, petridishes] with an TEMPLATE[w, agar plate, agar-solution] where fungus can grow on. A day after, we counted how many spores were still alive.\",\"TEMPLATE[WNIQ, Wikinews] How TEMPLATE[w, Reliability (psychometrics), reliable] do you consider your results to be?\",\":NB The results we got are very reliable. We had a lot of colonies containing a lot of ants, and wherever possible we conducted the experiment blind. This means the experimenter doesn\\u0027t know which ants belong to which treatment, so it\\u0027s impossible to influence the results  with \\u0027TEMPLATE[w, Observer-expectancy effect, observer bias]\\u0027. However, of course this is proof in just one  species. It is hard to extrapolate to other ants, as different species  lead very different lives.\",\"TEMPLATE[QuoteLeft, At the moment it seems that sick ants mostly take care of the problem themselves] TEMPLATE[WNIQ, Wikinews] Where did the ants and fungus you used come from? How common are they in the wild?\",\":NB For ants, see above about the collection.\",\":This species of fungus does appear in Finland, but we chose to use a  different strain from Denmark (with thanks to Prof. J. Eilenberg and  the laboratory technician Louise Lee Munch Larsen from the University  of Copenhagen). Animals can adapt to local strains (\\u0027local  adaptation\\u0027), and just to make sure we thought it would be good to use  a strain of fungus that the ants definitely did not evolve specific resistances against. This means that the reaction of the ants (to self-medicate) is very likely to be a general response, and not just  against their local fungal enemies.\",\"TEMPLATE[WNIQ, Wikinews] Are there any ethical considerations around exposing ants to toxins and parasites?\",\":NB Legally, no. Insects do not have any \\u0027rights\\u0027 as such regarding  ethics. That said, we do take measures to not make them \\u0027suffer  unnecessarily\\u0027. For example, dissections are done when the ants are anesthetized (either by CO2 or Ice), and when ants need to be killed,  we do it in alcohol, which kills the ants in a matter of seconds. So while the ants do not have \\u0027rights\\u0027 as such, we still try to handle them with as much respect as possible (even though the experiment  involves infecting them with a deadly fungus).\",\":But even though the 12,000 ants in our study sounds like a lot (and it is), this is negligible in the \\u0027grand scheme of things\\u0027. It has been  calculated that in the Netherlands alone, nearly a trillion insects die against just the licence-plates of cars every six months. I don\\u0027t own a car, so that means I\\u0027m excused right? ;)\",\"TEMPLATE[WNIQ, Wikinews] This is the first evidence for self-medicating insects. How widespread do you think this phenomenon could be in reality?\",\":NB It\\u0027s not actually the first evidence for self-medication in insects. Moths and fruit flies definitely do it, and there\\u0027s evidence in honey bees and bumble-bees as well. So it seems to be quite wide-spread in  the insect world. I have no doubt that as time goes on, there will be  more and more cases documented. Insects (and animals in general) seem  to be quite good at taking care of themselves.\",\"TEMPLATE[WNIQ, Wikinews] How might ants locate healing substances in the wild?\",\":NB Very good question. This is something that\\u0027s important to know. If they would only do it in the lab, the behaviour wouldn\\u0027t be very interesting. We have some guesses where they might get it from, but at the moment we don\\u0027t know yet. That said, I plan to investigate this  question (among others) further [in] the next couple of years.\",\"TEMPLATE[WNIQ, Wikinews] For your PhD you researched ants\\u0027 scent-based communications. Could healthy ants perhaps tell other ants are infected and encourage this behaviour?\",\":NB There\\u0027s not much known about this. There\\u0027s conflicting evidence about whether sick ants actually smell different from healthy ones or not. At the moment it seems that sick ants mostly take care of the problem themselves. Sick ants stop most interaction with nestmates and especially brood, and leave the nest to die in isolation. This is probably for reducing chance of infecting nestmates, but of course it  also reduces the work load of their nest-mates, as their corpse  doesn\\u0027t have to be dragged out etc.\",\":So as an answer to the question, I would find it unlikely that such a  behaviour would evolve, but it\\u0027s not known yet.\",\"TEMPLATE[WNIQ, Wikinews] Ants generally avoided the peroxide if they were healthy, but in some circumstances might they try to build resistance against infection in advance?\",\":NB Who knows? Also not known yet unfortunately. That said, there is a very interesting study about resin collection in ants. TEMPLATE[w, Wood ants] collect tree-resin, which has anti-microbial properties. They collect this even if not infected, and when you infect them, they don\\u0027t collect more of the resin than normal. So basically it seems like they  collect it in order to keep diseases out of the nest, so they stop the disease before it can actually infect them.\",\"TEMPLATE[WNIQ, Wikinews] Are there plans to follow this research up? Might you research other species? Other substances?\",\":NB I first want to find out where they get it from in nature. There might  be many sources of medicine (recent evidence suggests that tobacco  plays a similar role for bumble bees). Dalial Freitak, who is also on this paper is currently running tests with Ph.D. student Siiri Fuchs (who is also on the paper) with other substances to see if any have the same effect as H2O2 [hydrogen peroxide].\",\":Once the behaviour has been well described in this species of ant, I might do a comparison with other species. For example, once we find the source of the medicine in nature... would species without access to this source also have evolved the same behaviour in the lab? And if so... where would they get it from?\",\":Also... can ants medicate their friends? :)\",\"TEMPLATE[WNIQ, Wikinews] What other research are you working on right now?\",\":NB Phew...lots! :)\",\":I still have some questions left unanswered from my Ph.D. work related to how ants recognize who is a friend and who isn\\u0027t. I also started  collaborating with Prof. Michael Poulsen from the University of  Copenhagen on immunity in fungus-growing termites, as well as their  chemical recognition abilities. Furthermore we\\u0027re working on social parasitism in wood-ants (ants have lots of animals exploiting the nest for shelter and resources, which all somehow have to get in to the fortress without getting killed).\",\"TEMPLATE[haveyoursay] TEMPLATE[Science_and_technology_-_horizontal]\",\"TEMPLATE[sisters, w, Entomopathogenic fungus,

TEMPLATE[Image_credit, [http://www.flickr.com/people/10345599@N03 Francisco Anzola]] The international research, led by Yale University in the US, used satellite images to examine over 400,000 plots of land for estimated tree density.

The study puts 43% of trees in the tropics, where deforestation is particularly common.\",\"The study also claims the number has been cut by human activity from around six trillion 12,000 years ago.

TEMPLATE[image_credit, [[US]] (TEMPLATE)]TEMPLATE[w, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration] De Vries says several times \\\"lock is on\\\" on the TEMPLATE[w, cockpit voice recorder, voice recording], adding \\\"I can\\u0027t stop it\\\" moments before the crash. Gulfstream had installed a mechanism to prevent the throttle fully moving when gust lock was engaged, to give pilots a clear early warning something was amiss.\",\"The NTSB found the throttle could still be pushed far enough to reach takeoff speed. The FAA had certified the system based on technical drawings. The NTSB said the FAA process was \\\"inadequate\\\" because there were no \\\"engineering certification tests or analysis[...] to verify that the system had met its regulatory requirements.\\\" Gulfstream say they are working with the FAA to rectify the issue.\",\"The NTSB says it took ten seconds from noticing the problem before the crew began braking and another four seconds to power down the engines. The NTSB believes doing both within eleven seconds would have brought the flight to a halt on the runway.\",\"The lock was applied upon landing six hours earlier. The flight was carrying four passengers, including entrepreneur and philanthropist TEMPLATE[w, Lewis Katz], back from a fundraiser. The seventh fatality was a flight attendant. Katz had co-engineered an TEMPLATE[w, united States dollar, $]88 million takeover deal for the TEMPLATE[w, Philadelphia Inquirer] four days earlier.\",\"The Katz family later sold his stake in the paper to a business partner. Katz had hoped to boost the paper\\u0027s reputation.\",\"\\\"Complacency does not have a place in the cockpit of any aircraft\\\", NTSB Vice Chairman Bella Dinh-Zarr said. The probe found skipped checks on 98% of the prior 175 flights the pilots undertook together. \\\"If you\\u0027re acting that way, you are just fooling yourself,\\\" said NTSB member Robert Sumwalt, who has 32 years of commercial flight experience.

The plant\\u0027s drainage system has been inundated by a surge of sea water brought in by the typhoon, which reached Japan on Wednesday. A spokesperson for TEPCO, the company that runs the plant, yesterday said they were investigating the leaked water but it did not present a significant danger.\",\"This comes after authorities in eastern Japan ordered over 100,000 people to leave the area as a precautionary measure as the typhoon proceeded to flood the town of TEMPLATE[w, Joso]. Up to 25 people are still missing and at least three are dead as a consequence of the flooding. Hundreds of thousands more people in the region have been encouraged to evacuate as well. Rescue efforts are being hampered by the floods, with some people being plucked from roofs and cars by teams in helicopters.\",\"The Fukushima nuclear plant was damaged after a huge earthquake and tsunami in March 2011. As recently as April this year there were concerns about leakages as a result of electrical problems with water pumps that caused contaminated water to escape into the TEMPLATE[w, Pacific Ocean]. A large volume of water used as part of the cooling mechanism before the reactors were damaged has since been stored in numerous steel drums.\",\"TEMPLATE[haveyoursay]\",\"TEMPLATE[Publish]

By various reports seven or nine people were also injured. Officials said Mercer killed himself during the subsequent shootout with police.\",\"Mercer began the killing spree in a class where he was a student by shooting the class teacher, and killed eight students in that and at least one other classroom. In the next classroom, a student nurse unsuccessfully tried to save the life of her friend who was wounded by the gunman. Another student, ex-soldier Chris Mintz, was shot seven times after coming to help.\",\"The reasons for the attack are not known but TEMPLATE[w, CNN] reports he singled out people who identified themselves as TEMPLATE[w, Christianity, Christian].

State laws permit people to carry concealed weapons in higher education institutions and at least one other person at the college was armed.

TEMPLATE[Health] The TEMPLATE[w, Royal Free Hospital] in TEMPLATE[w, London] yesterday said a nurse suffering with complications after Ebola, Pauline Cafferkey, is \\\"critically ill\\\" after her

Cafferkey, 39, was readmitted to an isolation unit at the Royal Free on the night of October 8\\u0026ndash;9 where she had spent time earlier in the year after contracting Ebola in TEMPLATE[w, Sierra Leone] whilst treating patients with the infection.\",\"The hospital said in a statement: \\\"We are sad to announce that Pauline Cafferkey\\u0027s condition has deteriorated and she is now critically ill. She is being treated for Ebola in the high level isolation unit at the Royal Free Hospital.\\\" TEMPLATE[image, [[Commons:User:Ryan4314~commonswiki, User:Ryan4314]]] Cafferkey visited an TEMPLATE[w, out-of-hours service, out of hours GP] clinic on October 5 where her symptoms were not linked to Ebola, before deciding to go to the TEMPLATE[w, Queen Elizabeth University Hospital] in TEMPLATE[w, Glasgow] on October 6 where she was treated at the hospital\\u0027s infectious diseases unit. Two days later, she was flown by plane to the Royal Free. She is the only person known to suffer with Ebola in this way for a second time, which can remain in the body after an initial recovery.\",\"Jonathan Ball of the TEMPLATE[w, University of Nottingham] said he\\u0027d heard of nothing like this. \\\"I am not aware from the scientific literature of a case where Ebola has been associated with what we can only assume as life-threatening complications after someone has initially recovered, and certainly not so many months after.\\\"\",\"Pauline\\u0027s sister Toni Cafferkey was critical of the wrong diagnosis, telling the TEMPLATE[w, Sunday Mail (Scotland), Sunday Mail] newspaper, \\\"At that point me and my family believe they missed a big opportunity to give the right diagnosis and we feel she was let down. Instead of being taken into hospital, she spent the whole of Tuesday very ill\\\".\",\"A spokesperson for NHS Glasgow and Clyde said Pauline Cafferkey did receive a diagnosis from an out of hours clinic and said: \\\"Her management and the clinical decisions taken based on the symptoms she was displaying at the time were entirely appropriate.  All appropriate infection control procedures were carried out as part of this episode of care.\\\"\",\"Experts say they do not believe the infection recurring within Pauline Cafferkey is contagious despite monitoring 58 people she has been in contact with. This is said to be a precaution as Ebola can only be spread through body fluids and the infection is not creating the same symptoms associated with a one-off diagnosis of Ebola.\",\"TEMPLATE[haveyoursay]\",\"TEMPLATE[Publish] TEMPLATE[Archive]\",\"CAT:Ebola virus\"],\"categories\":[{\"id\":\"Category:_October_14,_2015\",\"description\":\"Category: October 14,

three-man crew early yesterday morning. The three fishermen said they were abandoning ship in favour of a lifeboat. The search, which covered roughly 170 TEMPLATE[w, square kilometre, square km], earlier located an empty lifeboat from FV Jubilee.\",\"A police dive team was sent today to look for bodies. Police and owner-operator Ocean Fisheries believe the missing men are deceased. Weather conditions at the site, around 40 TEMPLATE[w, metre, m] deep and 22 TEMPLATE[w, kilometre, km] from the TEMPLATE[w, Rakaia River] mouth, are reported with dropping wind and swells of 1.5 m.\",\"\\\"The sea conditions were rough,\\\" said Ocean Fisheries boss Andrew Stark; \\\"without knowing what was going wrong with the vessel we really can\\u0027t speculate, whether the sea was a cause or a contributing factor. Rough conditions are usual at sea, so we don\\u0027t believe the weather was severe enough to be the main contributing factor. There must have been something involved prior to that which caused the vessel to sink.\\\"\",\"Stark said the accident is \\\"a mystery\\\".

The fourth time, they tried something else \\u0026mdash; based on TEMPLATE[w, Flight Data Recorder] readouts, investigators believe they reset power to their Flight Augmentation Computers.\",\"The computers are principally responsible for rudder control and aircraft stability. With both computers switched off, the entire TEMPLATE[w, fly-by-wire] system of semi-automation disconnected, as did the TEMPLATE[w, autopilot] and TEMPLATE[w, autothrust] systems. The pilots were now left to fly entirely manually, without automation that protects the aircraft from entering unusual and dangerous positions.\",\"A miscommunication followed. Iriyanto asked Plesel, who was flying, to \\\"pull down\\\". Plesel pulled the controls down, which pitched the nose up; Iriyanto had wanted to descend. The flight ascended without permission through 36,000ft with a TEMPLATE[w, ground speed] of 353TEMPLATE[w, knot (unit), knts]. The aircraft would normally be travelling faster, with a nearby TEMPLATE[w, Emirates (airline), Emirates] jet at a ground speed of 503knts at 36,000ft. The aircraft also banked as the disengagement of automation left the rudder off-centre. TEMPLATE[image_credit, Antonio P. Turretto Ramos, (TEMPLATE)]TEMPLATE[w, US Navy] The AirAsia flight reached 38,000ft and entered a TEMPLATE[w, aerodynamic stall, stall]. The crew did not manage to regain control. The 155 passengers and seven crew died when the plane hit the sea. Most were Indonesians, but for three South Koreans, one Malaysian, one Brit, and French national Plesel.\",\"The fault was traced to cracked TEMPLATE[w, solder] on a circuit board. It had repeatedly occurred in the weeks before the crash. The investigation concluded maintenance failings contributed to the disaster, but Muhammad Alwi of the Indonesian Transportation Ministry said \\\"Repeated trouble in maintenance is a normal thing[...] If the trouble is fixed in accordance with the manual maintenance procedures, then it\\u0027s alright\\\".\",\"Investigators believe the solder crack is attributable to extreme temperature changes in the unprotected compartment near the tail that houses the component.\",\"The investigation further found the flight crew were untrained in recovering from extreme events. AirAsia boss Tony Fernandes said yesterday \\\"there is much to be learned here for AirAsia, the manufacturer and the aviation industry... We will not leave any stone unturned to make sure the industry learns from this tragic incident\\\".\",\"The report also dismisses weather as a contributory factor. The flight was diverting around storms in the area.\",\"Iriyanto and Plessel had over 8,000 hours experience between them. Iriyanto had a decade of experience training other pilots, and previous employers include the air force. They spent three minutes struggling to regain control as the pane fell to the sea. Some bodies were recovered around 1,000km away near Sulawesi.\",\"AFP spoke to Terence Fan, an air industry expert from TEMPLATE[w, Singapore Management University], who said \\\"It\\u0027s a scenario that has played out in air accidents in the past[...] Pilots are either distracted by a faulty equipment or cannot properly solve the issue and something else is brewing in the background.\\\"\",\"One such accident was the loss of Air France Flight 447 in 2009 into the Atlantic. It was investigated by the BEA of France, which also assisted the AirAsia probe. The BEA issued recommendations on how to train pilots after the Air France crash. Ex-BEA boss Jean-Paul Troadec said to AFP \\\"Several recommendations of the (BEA) on the subject of pilot training were clearly not implemented by [AirAsia].\\\"\",\"Indonesia saw such an accident on New Years\\u0027 Day 2007 when Adam Air Flight 574 crashed into the Makasser Strait near Sulawesi. The plane suffered a failure on a navigational instrument. While pilots were troubleshooting for this navigational system they first unintentionally disconnected the autopilot, then lost control and crashed into the sea.\",\"TEMPLATE[haveyoursay]\",\"TEMPLATE[sisters, w, Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501] TEMPLATE[sisters, commons, Category:Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501]\",\"TEMPLATE[Publish] TEMPLATE[Archive]\"],\"categories\":[{\"id\":\"Category:Asia\",\"description\":\"Category:Asia\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Indonesia\",\"description\":\"Category:Indonesia\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Disasters_and_accidents\",\"description\":\"Category:Disasters and accidents\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Transport\",\"description\":\"Category:Transport\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Aviation\",\"description\":\"Category:Aviation\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Indonesia_AirAsia_Flight_8501\",\"description\":\"Category:Indonesia AirAsia Flight 8501\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Java_Sea\",\"description\":\"Category:Java Sea\"},{\"id\":\"Category:National_Search_and_Rescue_Agency\",\"description\":\"Category:National Search and Rescue Agency\"},{\"id\":\"Category:National_Transportation_Safety_Committee\",\"description\":\"Category:National Transportation Safety Committee\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Weather\",\"description\":\"Category:Weather\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Iain_Macdonald_(Wikinewsie)\",\"description\":\"Category:Iain Macdonald (Wikinewsie)\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Sulawesi\",\"description\":\"Category:Sulawesi\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Singapore\",\"description\":\"Category:Singapore\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Juanda_International_Airport\",\"description\":\"Category:Juanda International Airport\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Changi_International_Airport\",\"description\":\"Category:Changi International Airport\"},{\"id\":\"Category:South_Korea\",\"description\":\"Category:South Korea\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Korean_Peninsula\",\"description\":\"Category:Korean Peninsula\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Malaysia\",\"description\":\"Category:Malaysia\"},{\"id\":\"Category:United_Kingdom\",\"description\":\"Category:United Kingdom\"},{\"id\":\"Category:France\",\"description\":\"Category:France\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Aerodynamic_stalls\",\"description\":\"Category:Aerodynamic stalls\"},{\"id\":\"Category:AirAsia\",\"description\":\"Category:AirAsia\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Tony_Fernandes\",\"description\":\"Category:Tony Fernandes\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Bureau_of_Enquiry_and_Analysis_for_Civil_Aviation_Safety\",\"description\":\"Category:Bureau of Enquiry and Analysis for Civil Aviation Safety\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Air_France_Flight_447\",\"description\":\"Category:Air France Flight 447\"},{\"id\":\"Category:Adam_Air_Flight_574\",\"description\":\"Category:Adam Air Flight 574\"}],\"templates\":[{\"name\":\"date\",\"description\":[\"December 2, 2015\"]},{\"name\":\"Aviation\",\"description\":[]},{\"name\":\"image_credit\",\"description\":[\"[[Commons:User:Sabung.hamster\",\"Oka Sudiatmika]]\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"Airbus A320-200\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"Juanda International Airport\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"Changi International Airport\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"rudder travel limiter\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"Electronic Centralised Aircraft Monitor\",\"Electronic Centralized Aircraft Monitoring (ECAM) system\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"Flight Data Recorder\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"fly-by-wire\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"autopilot\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"autothrust\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"ground speed\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"knot (unit)\",\"knts\"]},{\"name\":\"w\",\"description\":[\"Emirates (airline)\",\"Emirates\"]},{\"name\":\"image_credit\",\"description\":[\"Antonio P.

Saturn\u00e2\u0080\u008e, Burke discusses his political background, his 2016 presidential campaign, and his policy proposals.\",\":TEMPLATE[WNIR, Steve Burke]  The only way to answer your question is by semi story okay? I was asked once to take over the fight to save the county infirmary from closure. It housed ill and hopeless cases.  I felt it was the county\\u0027s obligation to keep it open. Just as I believe we have an obligation to the mentally ill who need a hospital setting instead of the street or jail. So I took on the county and organized the seniors, relatives of the patients and went to work until the county elected officials cried uncle and kept it open.  In fact they built a brand new infirmary and I believe it is still open. I last stopped there in the 1990s to visit a man I became friends with at the infirmary. He was bed ridden after he was stabbed with a knife in the back and it severed his spine. The county infirmary is owned by TEMPLATE[w, Suffolk County, New York, Suffolk County] but in the town of Brookhaven. When I was first elected to the Brookhaven council, I felt we could now start to help the people. What a shock I got and lessons no political course in school can teach. There [were] some minor patronage jobs available. One person who was a disabled vet wanted some part time work.  I spoke with my board members and they agreed to give him a bingo inspector job. About four evenings a month minor pay. On our very first meeting I looked at the agenda and his name was not there. I asked why and they told me they decided to give it to a bartender where they ate and drank. Because he made good drinks. That did not fly with me. I called them all into a room and spoke with them and the party leader by phone. The result was that day the disabled vet got the position and held it until he passed on.  So back stabbing, back biting, always looking to get even [are] the lessons I learned the hard way from my fellow elected officials. But it taught me how to get things done. Former New Hampshire U.S. Senator TEMPLATE[w, Warren Rudman, [Warren] Rudman] said when he quit the Senate, he could not get over the hatred and back stabbing in Washington.   So I guess when you deal with elected egos it is the same all over. The town had a few hundred vehicles they owned and the employees drove.  Remember Brookhaven is the largest town in New York. I was assigned the public safety department.  I found the town cars were unaccounted for. No one knew where they were or who had them. Some I found in back yards of employees with parts missing, invoices of repairs not done on town cars but on personal cars and charged to the town.  I stopped all of that, put the repairs out to bid. Made a depot to pick up and drop off daily a car. Changed the color and bought smaller vehicles. I also started a repair yard with town mechanics. When the bid expired. I saved the local police/code enforcement department that they wanted to get rid of.  They took care of our parks and buildings, etc. I think I put in a resolution to push for the five cent return bottles, cans, etc., or maybe I just brought it up. I am not sure. That was before the state did it. The town TEMPLATE[wikt, dog pound] was a problem.  I heard they were selling dogs and cats out the back door to labs and for guard dog companies.  I got the town board to go in with me one evening and seize the records. We went through them and turned them over to the district attorney.  It was not followed up.  But there [were] no more rumors of dogs or cats going out the back door. I am sure there was more but that was 30 years ago. You will have to cut it down. One builds up enemies if you do anything as an elected official. Those that last a long time are generally do nothings, no waves.\",\":TEMPLATE[WNIR, SB] I am the only Democrat on the five person board. So the entire board has to take credit of keeping tax increases below 2% a year without going into our fund balance. In fact our fund balance is the best of the other 31 towns and the county of St. Lawrence. We have lowered the cost of health care along with our tax base. Upgraded equipment, put money aside for replacement equipment, made our buildings energy efficient. Then we started at the beginning of each meeting the TEMPLATE[w, Pledge of Allegiance] and a short prayer to the Almighty. Best of all we have no debt.\",\":TEMPLATE[WNIR, SB] This was a strong Republican county when I first became chair. I was able to turn the county around to Democrat, but now it has fallen back to Republican. I started the first resource guide that allowed us to raise funds, obtained a house for the first time ever headquarters. Hillary Clinton won her first Senate seat with just 10 counties out of 62 in New York. We were one of those 10 counties when I was chair. I served as chair and was called back after several years to be chair again. I left the party in both a happy, strong and good financial condition.\",\":TEMPLATE[WNIR, SB] I am impressed that you did some investigative work. It is rare today. Good for you. You should go far in this field. The country was just starting to feel the impact of a slowdown. I wanted to speak out as to what I saw and speak to the issues of the day. I learned that it was a closed shop then and has gotten worse both in ability to be recognized and the economic situation.  TEMPLATE[w, NAFTA] and all free trade policies are detrimental to our economical health, jobs, income and general well being of the country.  When NAFTA was first proposed I was chair and spoke out against it and was given heat for it. But oh well I swim upstream anyway.\",\":*TEMPLATE[WNIQ, WSS] Did you run in any presidential primaries in 1992?\",\":::TEMPLATE[WNIR, SB] I ran in six states total and did the best [in] Louisiana.\",\":TEMPLATE[WNIR, SB] No I will not join any other party.

All the closed factory and manufacturing buildings around the country need to be used. Let\\u0027s find the people with skills to open them up and get them running. The government will have a startup fund to lend, so we can be self sufficient again. By closing some of our TEMPLATE[w, List of United States military bases, military bases] around the world that money can be used in this country and the military brought home to help secure our borders. Remember we are bleeding money and must stop it or we are done. One of the best things I feel for all our young is to have a military draft for a two year period of their lives. It teaches them order and how to get along and live with people of all colors and religions.  Add a TEMPLATE[w, Civilian Conservation Corps, CCC] type of organization to that and give them a choice.  Then add a TEMPLATE[w, G.I. Bill, GI] type of benefits to that. As a correction officer I saw the hopelessness of prisoners who could not read or write but were smart.  If the government uses its money and talent not just on early intervention but in all grades to help these kids who have trouble in school reading and writing etc. Americans right now feel a sense of no one cares and we are going nowhere. Lack of jobs, money, housing. If you are married William then you know money in marriage is the big problem not sex.  We have people with ideas in this country.  Let\\u0027s use them to make our country self sufficient again. Let\\u0027s show the country through leadership that we are moving forward together towards a goal. No more making scapegoats out of each other. Those in office have a hunger for more and more money because they have a need???? Well so do those working or having a business. Let\\u0027s not tax them to death. We all want to have the good life.  Let\\u0027s work towards that goal. I see the problems and know there are answers by setting goals, direction and leadership.

I was on TEMPLATE[w, 60 Minutes] for some legislation I sponsored against TEMPLATE[w, Teflon] coated bullets that can pass through armored police vests.
